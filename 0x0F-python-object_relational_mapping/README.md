##0-select_states.py


Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


 1-filter_states.py
 
 Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


2-my_filter_states.py


Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
You must use format to create the SQL query with the user input
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported



3-my_safe_filter_states.py


Once again, write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (safe from MySQL injection)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

4-cities_by_state.py

Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
You can use only execute() once
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


 5-filter_cities.py
 
 Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name (SQL injection free!)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
You can use only execute() once
The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported
